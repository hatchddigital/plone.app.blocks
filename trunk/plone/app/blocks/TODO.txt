plone.app.blocks - todo
=======================

Bugs:

  * The DOCTYPE is lost after applying the XSLT in tile page rendering mode

Functionality:

  * Framework for representing, registering and enumerating layouts

Integration:

  * Deco theme, where main_template just selects a layout and fills a few
    panels; common functionality is exposed via tiles.
  * Deco editing of layouts and panels
  * Deco UI for selectively overriding panels when working with layouts

Other:

  * Support for saving common content templates (e.g. news item, event) in
    Deco
  * Pure-XSLT version
